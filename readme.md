It's a game of "Battleship" that works in the console. In my case, it is designed to remember the basics of the Python language.

At the moment it has a primitive design:  
 1) A "-" symbol means that this cell is free and has not been shot at.  
 2) The "#" symbol means that there is a ship in that cell.  
 3) The "%" symbol means that there is a ship in this cell that has been hit.  
 4) The "^" symbol means that this cell has been shot at and is empty.
